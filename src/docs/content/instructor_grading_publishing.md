### Submission views

In **Submissions**, use the view that matches your workflow:

- **By Student** for per-student progress
- **By Grader** for workload balancing

### Submission statuses

- **Unfinalized**: actively being graded
- **Finalized**: grading complete and ready for release

### Core grading sequence

1. Open submission in Code Console.
2. Review files and comments.
3. **Rubric Scoring**:
   - Click rubric items to apply them.
   - Use the search bar to find specific criteria.
   - Custom comments can be added for feedback not covered by the rubric.

4. **Review**: Check test outputs and code execution results.
5. **Finalize**: Toggle the "Finalized" switch when grading is complete. This signals to admins that the submission is ready.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up your grading with these hotkeys:

- **General**:

## Publish workflow

Students do not see grades/feedback until publish is performed.

- Go to **Assignments > Overview**
- Click **Publish Grades**
- Choose to notify students via email (optional)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Treat publish as a coordinated release event. Confirm policy checks (late submissions, exceptions, regrade queue) first.

## Export workflow

To export grades:

1. Open assignment or course grade export action.
2. Download CSV.
3. Validate student identifiers and totals before external upload.

## Operational playbook

### Before publish

- Confirm finalization threshold reached
- Resolve obvious missing grades
- Spot-check rubric consistency

### After publish

- Monitor regrade requests
- Track known rubric clarifications
- Export and archive grade snapshots
