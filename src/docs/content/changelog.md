## v4.2.0 — Assignment & Feedback Lifecycle, Exam Lockdown

> **Highlight**: Assignment publishing and feedback release are now two clear, independent
> badges — each with more states, scheduling, and safer defaults — and quizzes can require
> Safe Exam Browser. See the updated
> [Assignment Workflow](/docs/instructor-assignment-workflow) and
> [Grading, Release & Exports](/docs/instructor-grading-publishing) guides.

### New: Assignment Status badge (six states)

Each assignment now moves through an explicit lifecycle:
**Draft → Visible → Preview → Published → Closed → Archived**.

- **Draft** — invisible to students. New assignments (and clones) start here, so nothing
  is accidentally live while you set it up.
- **Visible** — students see the name, due date, and description: an announcement.
- **Preview** — students can also read the hand-out files, but can't submit yet.
- **Published** — open for work.
- **Closed** — happens **by itself** when the due date (plus any late window) passes; the
  badge shows a small clock. Extend the due date to reopen, or close early by hand.
- **Archived** — retired mid-course.

Set **Publish at** in the assignment settings to open an assignment automatically on
schedule — no more 11:59pm publishing from your couch.

### New: Feedback badge (four modes)

Releasing grades is now its own control next to Status, so *when students can work* and
*when they see grading* never get tangled:

- **Hidden** (default) — grade at your own pace, nothing shows.
- **Live** — feedback appears as it's written; good for office hours and exercises.
- **Per student** — each student sees their feedback as soon as *their own* submission is
  finalized — a rolling release with no global switch.
- **Released** — everything is out at once.

**Hide grades** still masks numeric scores in any revealing mode, and **Release at**
schedules an automatic global release ("grades out Friday 5pm").

### New: Safe Exam Browser for quizzes

Require a quiz to be taken in [Safe Exam Browser](https://safeexambrowser.org) — a free
locked-down browser for Windows, macOS, and iPad. Students get a one-click **Launch in
Safe Exam Browser** button (no config files to distribute), the server rejects any quiz
request made outside SEB, and blocked attempts appear in the Activity Log. Per-student
exemptions (for platforms SEB doesn't support, like Linux or ChromeOS) live on the course
roster, and staff can see which attempts were verified.

### New: Assignment descriptions shown to students

The assignment description is now displayed where students actually look: the assignment
row on their dashboard expands to show it (from Visible onward), and it appears above the
files on the submission view.

### Improved: Datasets

Test-resource datasets are no longer copied into normal execution runs — they stage only
when a run actually uses them — and the assignment form makes dataset visibility and
selection clearer.

### Security & fixes

- Closed several gaps where students could interact with assignments they shouldn't see:
  hidden assignments no longer accept uploads (a state cloned assignments used to land
  in), per-section hiding is enforced on the server, and partner links can only be
  accepted by students who could submit themselves.
- After feedback release, student API responses no longer include staff-only settings
  (AI prompts, anonymous-grading configuration, and similar internals).
- Several notification emails (upload receipts, feedback notices, regrade reminders)
  failed to render in production due to a template typo — fixed.
- The student console no longer suggests feedback is available while it's still hidden.

## v4.1.0 — AI Provider Testing & Quiz Generation Polish

> **Highlight**: Test your AI provider connection end to end from the settings page, and
> AI question generation became a tracked job with progress and clear failures.

### New: AI Provider Connection Test

Course and organization AI settings gained a **Test connection** button — send a real
prompt (optionally overriding the model) and see the provider's response, response time,
and the model that actually answered. Test requests are tracked separately in the AI
usage dashboard under a `provider_test` type.

### Improved: AI Question Generation

Suggestion and per-student generation now run as tracked jobs with live progress and
explicit failure states, plus on-demand **manual generation and preview** for
personalized sections. AI work also moved to a dedicated worker, so heavy generation
can't slow down autograding.

### Fixed

- Production image builds could fail intermittently due to a packaging race — resolved.
- Tightened course API key management permissions, and quiz taking is now browser-only.

---

## v4.0.0 — Quizzes

> **Highlight**: A full quiz system — question banks, flexible quiz building, timed attempts with
> auto-grading, per-student AI-generated questions, Canvas import, and late-access codes.
> See the new [Quizzes guide](/docs/instructor-quizzes) for the complete workflow.

### New: Question Banks & Quizzes

Build **question banks** of reusable questions — multiple choice, multiple answers, true/false,
short answer, numerical, essay, and code (with a full code editor and starter code). Assemble
quizzes from **fixed questions**, **random draws** from a bank, or **per-student AI-generated
sections**. Quizzes can stand alone or **attach to an assignment** and open/close relative to its
lifecycle (after submission, after feedback, etc.) — the quiz score always stays separate from the
assignment grade.

- **Timing & attempts** — time limits, per-student accommodation multipliers, attempt limits, and
  a scoring policy (highest / latest / average) when multiple attempts are allowed.
- **Delivery options** — shuffle questions, one-question-at-a-time with optional backtracking.
- **Results controls** — decide when results are released (at submit or after close), whether
  students can reopen submitted attempts, and whether they see their answers and the correct ones.
- **Grading** — auto-graded question types score instantly; essay and code responses queue for
  manual grading with feedback, "grade and next," reopen, and a sandboxed **Run code** button for
  executing a student's answer. A dedicated **Quiz Grader** role lets TAs grade quizzes.
- **Results & item analysis** — per-student official scores with CSV export, plus per-question
  statistics to spot confusing items.

### New: Per-Student AI-Generated Questions

Add an **AI-generated section** to a quiz and each student gets a fresh set of questions grounded
in **their own submission** — a post-submission "understanding check." Prompt templates, file and
dataset variables, and starter presets (retasking, manual evaluation, explain-your-code) are built
in. You review, edit, and **approve every set before the student sees it** (or opt into
auto-publish) — and students never see any signal that a question was AI-assisted. AI-suggested
questions for banks and cross-semester question refresh round out the AI tooling.

### New: Canvas Import

Export quizzes from Canvas (QTI / Common Cartridge) and import them into a question bank —
optionally recreating the quizzes themselves. Imports are deduplicated and safe to re-run.

### New: Late-Access Codes

Generate a per-quiz **access code** to share with students who missed the deadline — entering it
starts their attempt after close with the normal time limit. Codes can be rotated or removed at
any time, and late starts are flagged and recorded in the Activity Log.

### Improved: Course Activity Log

Quiz activity is now recorded end-to-end: attempt starts (including late starts), submissions and
auto-submissions, grading actions, access-code changes, and generated-set approvals.

## v3.4.0 — Testing Framework Improvements & Persisted File Edits

> **Highlight**: Hidden test cases, learning objectives that aggregate across tests, new `hidden` / `objectives` parameters in the testing framework, and persisted edits to student submission files.

### New: Hidden Test Cases

Instructors can now mark any test case as **hidden**. Students see only whether the test passed or failed and how it affected their score — the test name, logs, and explanation are stripped before the response leaves the server. Graders and admins continue to see full output in the code review panel.

This is useful for:

- Anti-cheating tests that should not be reverse-engineered from output.
- Edge-case tests that you want to grade against but not reveal to students until after publishing.

### New: Learning Objectives

Each assignment can now define **learning objectives** that are linked to one or more test cases. Objectives let you communicate _what_ a student demonstrated (or missed) rather than just listing individual test results.

Each objective is configured with:

- A short identifier (`shortId`) that can be referenced from your test scripts.
- A display name and optional longer description.
- A **visibility mode** controlling when students see the objective:
  - `Always show`
  - `Show when tests pass`
  - `Show when tests fail`
  - `Admin only`
- An **aggregation mode** controlling how the objective's "met" status and score are computed from its linked tests:
  - `All linked tests must pass`
  - `At least one linked test must pass`
  - `Percentage of linked tests that pass`
  - `Weighted by test point values`

Objectives are returned alongside test results in the student feedback panel and gated by their visibility mode.

### New: `hidden` and `objectives` Parameters in the Testing Framework

Both parameters are recognized by the test parser for every supported language.

For languages with first-class test decorators/annotations, pass them directly:

```python
# Python / Notebook Python
@test(name="Handles empty input", points=2, hidden=True, objectives=["edge-cases"])
def test_empty(): ...
```

```java
// Java / JShell
@Test(name = "Handles empty input", points = 2, hidden = true, objectives = {"edge-cases"})
public void testEmpty() { ... }
```

For languages without decorators (R, C/C++, JS/TS/Node, Ruby, PHP), place an `@codepost` directive in the comment directly above the test:

```js
// @codepost hidden objectives=recursion,edge-cases
test("Handles deep recursion", 2, "...", function () { ... });
```

The parser supports `//`, `#`, `--`, and `/* */` comment styles. Any objective `shortId` referenced in a script that doesn't yet exist on the assignment is **auto-created** the first time the script is synced — you can then edit its display name, description, visibility, and aggregation in the Learning Objectives UI.

See the updated [Testing Guide](/docs/testing-guide) for the full syntax reference.

### New: Persisted Submission File Edits

Edits made by instructors and graders to a submission file in the code review panel are now **saved server-side** and survive page reloads. Previously, edits were lost when navigating away. The saved edit is associated with the user who last modified it and is delivered with the submission payload.

**Who can edit**:

- **Course admins / instructors** can always save edits.
- **Graders** can save edits only when the assignment's **Graders can edit submissions** setting is enabled.

The student's original uploaded file is never modified — the edit is stored alongside it.

### New: Mobile Improvements

Added new mobile pages for students graders and instructors with a simplified layout optimized for smaller screens. Students can view their grades directly from the mobile webpage, and instructors can view activity and change assignment settings on the go.

## v3.3.0 — AI Assistance, Dashboards & PDF Commenting

> **Highlight**: AI-powered suggested comments and summaries, redesigned dashboards for admins and graders, PDF annotation support, and a new student console.

### New: PDF Commenting

Instructors and graders can now **annotate PDF files** directly in the code review panel. Select text or regions in uploaded PDFs and leave inline comments just like with code files.

### New: AI Suggested Comments & Summaries

The AI assistant can now generate **suggested comments**, **descriptions**, and **assignment summaries**. Graders see AI suggestions while reviewing, and instructors can generate summaries of assignment-level trends. A new behavioral feedback system supports AB testing and iterative prompt development.

### New: Assignment Analytics Dashboards

New **analytics dashboards** are available for admins and graders with assignment-level usage and grading insights. Dashboards show grading progress, time-on-task, and submission trends.

### New: Student Console

The student-facing code console has been **redesigned** for a cleaner, faster experience. Console sessions are now prefetched so output loads instantly.

### New: Capabilities System

Introduced a **capabilities framework** for feature gating and progressive rollout. This allows features to be enabled for specific courses or organizations before a full launch.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed how messages are rendered in test case results.
- Fixed image display for test cases and rendering of images inside Jupyter markdown cells.

## v3.2.0 — AI Settings & Usage Analytics

> **Highlight**: Organization-level AI configuration, per-course inheritance, and comprehensive usage tracking with cost estimates.

### New: Organization-Level AI Settings

Organization admins can now configure a shared AI provider and API key from the **Organization Dashboard > AI Settings** tab. A course access policy controls which courses can inherit the org's key — choose from **All courses**, **Selected courses**, or **Disabled**. This eliminates the need for every course admin to manage their own API key.

### New: Course AI Inheritance

Courses can now inherit AI settings from their organization instead of configuring their own. When org AI is available, the Course Settings page shows a banner and a toggle to switch between the org's shared key and a course-specific key.

### New: AI Usage Dashboard

AI usage is now tracked automatically for every AI call (comment generation and test generation). Usage dashboards are available at three levels:

- **Course level** — in Course Settings, below AI configuration.
- **Organization level** — in the Organization Dashboard's AI Usage tab.
- **Platform level** — in the codePost Admin dashboard for superusers.

Each dashboard shows total requests, token counts, estimated costs, time-series charts, and breakdowns by assignment, course, or organization. Date range and granularity (hourly, daily, monthly) are configurable.

### New: Portkey Provider Support

Added **Portkey** as a first-class AI provider option. Portkey is an AI gateway that routes requests to multiple LLM providers. Select it from the provider dropdown, set your gateway URL, and optionally provide an API key.

### New: Model Dropdown with Live Provider Query

The model selector is now a **searchable dropdown** that automatically populates with curated models for the selected provider. When credentials are configured, it also fetches available models directly from your provider's API.

### New: API Key Hint

After saving an API key, a **masked hint** (e.g., `sk-…abc1`) is displayed below the key field so admins can verify which key is active without exposing it.

### New: Custom Token Rate Overrides

Organization and course admins can now **override per-model token cost rates** used for usage estimates. Useful for self-hosted models, volume pricing, or unlisted models. Expand **Custom Token Rates** in AI settings to view and edit rates.

### New: Per-Model Usage Breakdown

Usage dashboards now include a **Usage by Model** table showing token counts, costs, and request counts grouped by AI model. The org-level dashboard also shows course period for disambiguating same-named courses.

See the [AI Settings & Usage Guide](/docs/ai-guide) for full details.

### UI Improvements

- Actions buttons on the Instructors Assignment table are now a row of buttons with icons and tooltips instead of a dropdown to improve discoverability and reduce clicks.

### Bug Fixes

- Regrading Table now has a new view and fixed issue with no regrades showing for graders.

## v3.1.1 — Quality of Life Improvements & Bug Fixes

- User-facing changelog page — you're reading it!
- Improved notebook editor loading for notebook-based assignments.
- Fixed an issue where API tokens could not be generated.
- Tests now check syntax of code before saving to prevent syntax errors in test cases.
- Tests now check if target file exists before executing test scripts that reference files.
- Add CSV imports for sections.
- Improved UI for code console.

### Change: Test and Execution Workflow Improvements

- Tests and caching output now is selectable from assignment settings. Instructors can choose to disable automatic test execution and/or file caching on student submission if they prefer a more manual workflow.
